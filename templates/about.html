        <h2>🌎 Our Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h2>
        <p>
            Likharyo is committed to driving positive social and economic change in the Philippines. 
            We specifically contribute to two critical UN Sustainable Development Goals:

            <h3>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</h3>
            <p>
                By providing local artists with a digital storefront, Likharyo directly supports 
                artisans by giving them access to a wider market. Each purchase guarantees just 
                compensation and sustains a traditional craft, promoting full and productive 
                employment for Filipino creators.
            </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</h3>
            <p>
                We encourage consumers to prefer locally manufactured goods. Our site uses shop narratives 
                and product tags to highlight sustainable practices, such as the use of recycled materials 
                or conventional methods, promoting conscious and sustainable consumption patterns.

        <h2>🚀 The Pyronauts</h2>
        <p>
            We are the Pyronauts, a development group named to reflect our mission: like astronauts exploring 
            the infinite universe of Python, we build robust and innovative digital solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            We created Likharyo with the core belief that technology can be a powerful tool for social good, 
            economic empowerment, and cultural preservation.
